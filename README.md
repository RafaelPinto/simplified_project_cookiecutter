# Simpler cookiecutter
This is my version of the [Cookiecutter Data Science project](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/). I initially started using that project, but got confused and tangle with a lot of concepts I do not know. I couldn't find a step-by-step example using that project, so I decided to take a step back, and lay a project structure that makes sense to me and my work methodology. I suspect the complications I didn't unerstand from the original project are in part due to my inexperience, and in part due to the project's intention to cater to a broad audience, which adds overhead complexity, unecessary for the uninitiated (🙋‍♂️).
